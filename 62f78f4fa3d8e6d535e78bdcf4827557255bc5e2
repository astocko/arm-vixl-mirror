The whole point of having this template inside vixl was so that Android is an example of how you can integrate vixl inside your OS/distro (which might be using a different build system, like android does).\n\nThere are indeed no __ANDROID__ tags in vixl. That is wired I thought I have added some for the macros in globas.h they should be printing stuff to logcat rather then stdout. \n\nI will be putting together a patch for those soon.",
