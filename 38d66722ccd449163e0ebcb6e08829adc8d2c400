      "message": "The second argument -- RuntimeCallParameters -- should have a name.\n\nAlso, since we treat it as a mask, it\u0027s likely that (when we have more than one option) it will have a value that isn\u0027t one of the enum values. This is undefined (or perhaps implementation-defined) behaviour in C++; an enum variable is assumed to hold one of the defined values for its type.\n\nIf we\u0027re going to use it as a mask, we should pass a raw uint32_t or something similar. An enum is still useful for the definitions of the values.",

      "message": "An enum is slightly cleaner at call sites, and it also means that we can\u0027t forget. An enum is also easier to extend, and this field looks like it is designed to be extended; it is called \u0027parameters\u0027 rather than \u0027type\u0027, for example.\n\nI think there are merits in both approaches but the enum method is the convention in VIXL so we should stick to it.",
