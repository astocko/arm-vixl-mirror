      "message": "With this change, CallRuntime just becomes a pass-through.\n\nIn your other patch, I suggested renaming JumpToRuntime to TailCallRuntime. In that case, I think it might be better to have a CallRuntimeHelper function (ideally private).\n\nI\u0027m concerned about naming. In some contexts, a call is a type of branch and a jump is a branch that isn\u0027t a call, but in others, branch and jump are synonyms and neither of them are calls. I\u0027m not sure what context we can assume here.",
