But it is not coherent with `aarch32::MacroAssembler::EnsureEmitFor()`.\n\nI am not confident the AArch64 pools are very \u0027precise\u0027 when dealing with the margin before emission. But this precision was not a goal for the AArch64 pools.\n\nI raised http://jira.arm.com/browse/VIXL1-167 to unify, clarify, and clean the API and behaviour of pools.",
