      "message": "This patch does not change the meaning of `steps_`.\nThe interpretation of this number depends on what point in the code one looks at! It is correct when looking at the point where `steps_` is checked (`if (steps_ \u003e 0)`).\n\nI do have an idea to improve the logic, but I think we should do it in a separate patch. I\u0027ll come to chat about it.",
